# 🚀 Create With Intent: 52-Week LinkedIn Challenge

**Create With Intent** is a 52-week LinkedIn challenge made by Bruno M. Guerreiro as a self-imposed challenge to provide value to the community and build portfolio. The goal is to:

- Ship **one meaningful project** every week
- Share with the **community** on LinkedIn
- Grow from **zero to hero** to show people that, with creativity, you can do anything

## 📅 The 52 Projects

1. Invoice Generator

*Made for creators who ship, not shipmen who sail.*
